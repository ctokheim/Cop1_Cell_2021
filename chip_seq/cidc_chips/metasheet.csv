# metasheet.csv- This sheet groups your analysis into "runs" aka experiments.
# each run requires a RunName and at least one Treatment (Treat1) and an 
# optional Control sample (Cont1).  Use the sample names defined in config.yaml
# for Treatment and Control columns (they must match exactly).
#
# You can define up to 1 replicate-using Treat2 and Cont2. 
# ALL CONTROLS ARE optional (but missing treatments will throw an error!)
