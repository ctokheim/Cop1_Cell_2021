# Code for Cop1 paper

This github repository contains the code used for the manuscript "In vivo CRISPR Screens Identify E3 Ligase Cop1 as a Modulator of Macrophage Infiltration and Cancer Immunotherapy Target". For instructions on running each analysis, please follow the README within each sub-directory. This repository contains the code for the following analyses:

* ATACseq - analysis of open chromatin accessibility data with and with out Cop1 KO, as well as with and with out IFNG treatment
* rna_seq - RNA-seq pipeline code for Cop1 KO and Cebpd KO data
* chip_seq - ChIP-seq pipeline code for the transcription factor Cebpd
* scRNAseq - Description of scRNA-seq data analysis for Cop1 KO
* jupyter_notebooks - Jupyter notebooks for downstream data analysis of results
